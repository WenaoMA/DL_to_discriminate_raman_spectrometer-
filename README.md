# dl_to_discriminate_raman_spectrometer
Here are the codes used for implementing the relative methods in *"Development of Deep Learning Algorithms to Discriminate Giant Cell Tumor of Bone from Adjacent Normal Tissues by Confocal Raman Spectroscopy"*.
## run_KNN.py
To perform PCA and k-nearest neighbors to discriminate the frozen specimens of GCTB from adjacent normal tissues.
## run_LSTM.py
To perform LSTM-based network to discriminate the frozen specimens of GCTB from adjacent normal tissues and to differentiate the FFPE specimens of GCTB and adjacent normal tissues.
## run_SVM.py 
To perform PCA and SVM method to differentiate the FFPE specimens of GCTB and adjacent normal tissues.
